To install sfa-tk, simply unpack the file sfa_tk101.tar.gz into your
favorite Matlab directory. This is going to create a 'sfa_tk'
directory. The two subdirectories 'sfa_tk/lcov' and 'sfa_tk/sfa' have
to be added to the Matlab path variable 'MATLABPATH'. The subdirectory
'sfa_tk/demo' contains some demo functions, which you might want to
run to make sure that everything is installed in the right way.
