# EAs_analysis
This is a demo for paper entitled Learning to Describe Collective Search behaviour of Evolutionary Algorithms in Solution Space

The source code can be easily executed only by Matlab 2017a with deep learning toolbox.
Note:  The code execution requires at least 1G of GPU memory

If you just want to reproduce the results of the paper, you only need to execute demo_visualization.m. A trained CNN model is stored in the CNN_model directory, and a one-offspring behavior data is stored in the data_for_demo directory. The execution result of demo_visualization.m is saved in the result_CNN_visual_PCA directory.

If you want to re-training model, you can study the CNN directory.

If you want to regenerate the behavior data, you can look at the BehaviorDataCollection directory.
